# For each server you monitor, you will need a total of 1(by default) + 1(for serverMetrics) + 1(for jkMetrics) + 1(for each custom URL)

# According to the default config.yml and metrics.xml, we have only 1 server => 1(by default) + 1(for jkMetrics) + 1 (for serverMetrics) + 1(assume one custom URL ) = 4 threads for one server.
# By default we want to support 5 servers, so it is 5 * 4 = 20 threads.

# So, please edit this value based on the your configuration.
