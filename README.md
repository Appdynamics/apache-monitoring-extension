# AppDynamics Apache - Monitoring Extension

##Use Case

The Apache HTTP Server is a widely-used web server supported by the Apache Software Foundation. The Apache HTTP Server monitoring extension captures metrics from an Apache web server and displays them in the AppDynamics Metric Browser.


Metrics include:

   * Availability: Percentage of time that the server has been up; graphs server up/down status over time.
   * Health Check: Most recent and most severe logs, errrors, etc.
   * Activity: Throughput over the last minute including requests, bytes, etc.
   * Resource Utilization: Resources (threads, CPU, memory) currently in use and still available.
   * Efficiency: Server optimizations to maximize throughput such as caches, etc.

In addition, it lists:

   * Top Requests: Most requests by quantity and by volume, measured by number of bytes transferred.
   * Top Activity: Current activity such as responding, cleaning up, logging, etc.

##Installation
1. Install Apache mod_status on your Apache instance. For more information, see [Apache Module mod_status](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_status.html).

2. Use `curl` to verify that the URL works: http://your-apache-server:90/server-status?auto

   ```
   > curl http://localhost:90/server-status?auto
    Total kBytes: 3
    Total Accesses: 3
    Total kBytes: 3
    Uptime: 119503
    ReqPerSec: 2.5104e-5
    BytesPerSec: .0257065
    BytesPerReq: 1024
    BusyWorkers: 1
    IdleWorkers: 7
    Scoreboard: __W___……………….
   ```

3. Run `ant package`. Deploy the ApacheMonitor.zip file found in 'dist' into the \<machine agent home\>/monitors directory.

   ```
> cd <machine agent home>/monitors/
> unzip apachemon.zip
   ```
4. Setup task.properties with the correct host and port:
   -   host=your-apache-server
   -   port=90

   ```
   > cat <machine agent home>/monitors/ApacheMon/task.properties
   ```

​5. Restart the Machine Agent.

Output from this monitoring extension includes:

-   Counter Description CPU Load: The percentage of the CPU used by Apache.

-   Requests/Sec: The number of HTTP requests the web server is processing per second.

-   Bytes/Sec: The amount of data the web server is transferring per second.

-   Bytes/Requests Average: The average number of bytes being transferred per HTTP request.

-   Busy Workers: The number of Apache processes actively processing an HTTP request.

-   Idle Workers: The number of idle Apache processes waiting for an HTTP request.
